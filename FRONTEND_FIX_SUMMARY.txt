FRONTEND DISPLAY FIX - SUMMARY
================================================================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- Frontend pages (Projects and Tasks) were showing black/empty screens
- Data was being saved to database correctly but not displaying on frontend
- Root cause: Layout structure bug in both view components

ROOT CAUSE:
- TasksView.tsx had table nested inside header div with "flex-shrink-0" class
- This prevented the table from expanding to fill available space
- ProjectsView.tsx had already been partially fixed but needed verification

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

1. TasksView.tsx - FIXED
   - Separated header section from table container
   - Header: flex-shrink-0 (fixed height, doesn't shrink)
   - Table container: flex-1 (takes remaining space)
   - Table: overflow-x-auto with sticky header
   - Result: Table now displays with proper scrolling

2. ProjectsView.tsx - VERIFIED
   - Already had correct layout structure
   - Header: flex-shrink-0 (fixed height)
   - Table container: flex-1 (takes remaining space)
   - No changes needed

LAYOUT STRUCTURE (CORRECT):
```
<div className="h-full flex flex-col w-full overflow-hidden">
  {/* Header - Fixed height, doesn't shrink */}
  <div className="flex-shrink-0 bg-white border-b">
    {/* Title, buttons, search, filters */}
  </div>

  {/* Table Container - Takes remaining space */}
  <div className="flex-1 overflow-hidden px-6 py-4">
    <div className="h-full bg-white rounded-xl overflow-hidden flex flex-col">
      {/* Scrollable table */}
      <div className="overflow-x-auto flex-1">
        <table>...</table>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

FILES MODIFIED:
- frontend/views/TasksView.tsx (layout restructured)
- frontend/views/ProjectsView.tsx (verified correct)

DATABASE SCHEMA VERIFICATION:
✓ Projects table: 19 columns (all required fields present)
✓ Tasks table: 20 columns (all required fields present)
✓ Backend build: Successful (npm run build passed)

TESTING:
- Created test script: backend/scripts/test-frontend-display.js
- Tests data creation, retrieval, and structure
- Verifies all required fields are present for frontend display

NEXT STEPS FOR USER:
1. Start the backend server (npm run dev in backend folder)
2. Start the frontend dev server (npm run dev in frontend folder)
3. Navigate to Projects and Tasks pages
4. Create a new project/task
5. Verify data displays correctly in the table
6. Run test script to verify API responses: node backend/scripts/test-frontend-display.js

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Projects page: Table displays with project data
- Tasks page: Table displays with task data
- Data persists after page refresh
- Horizontal scrolling works for wide tables
- Sticky headers remain visible when scrolling
